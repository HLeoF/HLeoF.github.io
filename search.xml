        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Clustering-Analysis"><a href="#Clustering-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Clustering Analysis"></a>Clustering Analysis</h1><p>Clustering is an unsupervised learning. It can divide the objects of analysis into different groups based on their features, in other words dividing the data in the dataset into clusters with similar characteristics. The goal lets data within a category to be more similar than data between different categories. Clustering analysis is different from classification, which is a supervised learning method that requires learning a classification from a training dataset. Clustering analysis is widely used in the real world, it can be used in computer image recognition, medical image analysis, market research, commodity classification, etc.</p><h2 id="Partitioning-Clustering-VS-Hierarchical-Clustering"><a href="#Partitioning-Clustering-VS-Hierarchical-Clustering" class="headerlink" title="Partitioning Clustering VS. Hierarchical Clustering"></a>Partitioning Clustering VS. Hierarchical Clustering</h2><p>Clustering analysis has two types, which are Partitioning clustering and hierarchical clustering. Partitioning clustering is not hierarchical, it has not explicit structure between data to show that they are related to each other. K-Means and K-Medoids are the most common useful partitioning algorithms. Hierarchical clustering shows a hierarchical tree structure where each node represents a cluster. This method gradually merged data (<code>Agglomerative Clustering</code>) or divided (<code>Divisive Clustering</code>) until all the data was clustered together. It does not require the number of clusters (<code>K values</code>) to be specified in advance. Single-linkage, Complete-linkage, and Connectivity-based clustering are the most common algorithms of Hierarchical clustering. The time complexity of partitioning clustering is relatively low compared to the hierarchical distance, especially in the case of large data volume, because hierarchical clustering needs to consider the distance or similarity between the data for each step.</p><p><img src="/clustring/overview/1.png" alt="Partitioning Clustering Example"></p><p><img src="/clustring/overview/2.png" alt="Hierarchical Clustering Example"></p><p>The plots above show the difference between the two categories of clustering. The Euclidean distance is used here, which is calculated straight-line distance between two points. The advantage of the Euclidean method is that is relatively simple to implement and intuitive. If a dataset is a low-dimensional dataset, the effect of using it is perfect. The dataset used in these two plots is low-dimensional(dataset).</p><p>$$\text{Euclidean Distance} &#x3D; d(x,y) &#x3D; \sqrt{\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n} (x_{i}-y_{i})^2} $$</p><p>The most obvious difference between these two plots, as mentioned above, is that they show different structures. Partitioning clustering does not have a clear structure, and it can only be distinguished clusters by color and space.  The plot of hierarchical clustering can show the division of clusters by tree structure. Using the K &#x3D; 3 to display clusters, the partitioning and hierarchical plots have different amounts of data in each cluster. When using clustering analysis, may selecting different categories of clustering meets needs. For example, the partitioning method is a good choice when analyzing large-scale datasets, it is often more efficient and faster to perform. The hierarchical method is an option when exploring the structure of data clustering. It is suitable for working with small or medium-scale datasets, but it is expensive to work with large-scale datasets.</p><h1 id="Clustering-Plan"><a href="#Clustering-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Clustering Plan"></a>Clustering Plan</h1><p>Finding the relationship between the shooting quality efficiency of players in La Liga and the results of matches is explored by using clustering analysis. Selecting indexes include the total number of shots, the number of shots, the total number of goals, and the total number, which are important features to evaluate the quality and efficiency of the players’ shots.</p><p>Using K-mean algorithms and hierarchical clustering method to cluster the shooting indicators of players. Through these two algorithms, they are possible to find differences in shooting performance between different groups and explore whether shooting performance between different levels of players is correlated with match results and club rankings. It is super helpful to get a complete understanding of the impact of shooting quality on a club’s results. At the same time, compare the clustering effect produced by K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithm respectively to determine which method is more suitable for this project.</p><hr><h1 id="Resource"><a href="#Resource" class="headerlink" title="Resource"></a>Resource</h1><p><em><strong>Example Dataset<a href="">Dataset</a></strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Example K-Means Python Code<a href="">K-Means Code</a></strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Example Hierarchical Clustring R Code<a href="">Hierarchical Clustring Code</a></strong></em></p>]]></content>

At the same time, use <code>countbox</code> plots to check whether the values of those columns are all the same or all blank. The picture below shows variables of <code>injured</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>captain</code>, <code>game_minutes</code>, <code>penalty_won</code>, and <code>dribble_past</code> meet it, so they should be dropped. The <code>teamId</code> and <code>birthDate</code> are also not useful, they also should be removed. For the data club data, just drop the variable of <code>teamID</code>. Therefore, removing these attributes does not affect future tasks. The dataset of clubs almost perfect, it does not some NaN value, missing values, or incorrect values. Thus, dataset of clubs is clean and ready to use.</p><p><img src="/dataPrep/visual/1.png" alt="Check Arrtibute"></p><p>After that, searching and replacing the NaN in datasets. First, the player’s height and weight contain some NaN, and the quantity of them is small, so replacing these NaN values with height means and weight means. Other variables contain a lot of NaN data, such <code>game_assist</code>, <code>goal_saved</code>, <code>game_appearc</code>, etc. Because NaN is these columns mean 0, they also mean that players are not performing in these skills. Therefore, using 0 to replace NaN for these attributes is a good choice.</p><p>Last, changing some data types for the dataset, such as switching height and weight data types from string to integer.

Whether a player’s performance on the pitch (such as dribbling, shots, passes, yellow card, red card, etc.) can indicate the outcome of every game and affect a club’s position at the end of each season.</strong></em></p><h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>&emsp;In real life, a lot of analysis work has been done based on players’ statistics. For example, it is possible to access a player’s performance and potential by analyzing a player’s passing, shooting, dribbling, and other data. This way will support clubs in making more informed choices in the transfer market for each season. Also, players’ data is used to optimize the teams’ training sessions to help players improve their individual abilities and overall performance. More in-depth analysis of player data is now needed to better understand the role and impact of players in games. This word cannot only offer the team more tactical options but also guide the club to make more good decisions during training and games. At the same time, it is desirable to use data analysis to predict fluctuations in players’ states and their performance at critical moments so that improving the stability and combat effectiveness of the teams in a game. Therefore, through in-depth analysis of player data, the club can be provided with tactical options and decision-making support, thereby improving team performance and results during a season. </p><p>&emsp;Soccer is the number one sport in the world, with tens of thousands of soccer fans watching every weekend around the world. Many people like the fast pace and physicality of the Premier League, some like the defensive art of Serie A, and some people like the attacking football of the Bundesliga. According to the latest World Soccer League ranking (<a href="https://www.teamform.com/en/league-ranking/world/2024/q1">https://www.teamform.com/en/league-ranking/world/2024/q1</a>), La Liga is second in the world, and the main reason it has a large group fans&#x2F;audience is that La Liga is known for its ball control and exquisite technique. On the pitch of La Liga, each team’s 11 players operate like a sophisticated machine for 90 minutes. Each man on the pitch is a part of the machine, and their performance affects the operation of the entire machine. Therefore, the various clubs in La Liga pay great attention to the comprehensive quality of players. Every touch, every pass, every breakthrough of players on the pitch is silently writing the fate of a club’s entire season. Thus, just by standing on the pitch they are playing a key role in the success of a club. In the data era, the soccer area is like a tiger that has grown wings. A player’s individual stats will become what the team or scout focuses on, which is an essential factor in the success of the club’s strategic development and team management. In addition, it also provides fans with a deeper soccer-watching experience, making each player’s performance stand out to the audience. </p><p><img src="/introduction/1.jpg" alt="The Latest World Soccer League Ranking"></p><p>&emsp;Many people or fans may subconsciously believe that if a club purchases players who have wonderful individual abilities, the whole club will win all the trophies. However, it is not like FIFA or Football Manager games where players can win everything if they are good enough. One of the more famous examples, Real Madrid bought a large number of expensive players(<a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-galactico-ronaldo-beckham-all-real-madrids-super-signings/1lrrb6x9j0n9f1actzefqw47am">https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-galactico-ronaldo-beckham-all-real-madrids-super-signings/1lrrb6x9j0n9f1actzefqw47am</a>) in 2000 and formed the Galacticos I era(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1cticos#First_gal%C3%A1ctico_era_2">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1cticos#First_gal%C3%A1ctico_era_2</a>). At first, as the fans hoped, Real Madrid was able to win various titles from 2000 to 2002. However, since 2002, they have been unable to win any championships just like the honeymoon period of lovers is over. During this period, Real Madrid’s bitter rivals Barcelona won the championships in successive competitions. Therefore, a successful club may not often depend on the outstanding performances of individual players. If the whole club is not well coordinated or appears internal conflicts, the club’s results may also be affected. Besides, a player’s state fluctuation, injuries, and psychological quality are also important factors that affect the results of a game. Even players with outstanding individual skills can hurt the performance of the team once they are out of form or injured.</p><p><img src="/introduction/2.jpg" alt="The Players of Galacticos I Era"></p><h1 id="Questions"><a href="#Questions" class="headerlink" title="Questions"></a>Questions</h1><ul><li><p><strong>Whether the official rating of a player can verify the situation of a team (good or bad) and its future trend?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Does the quality of a player’s shooting determine the outcome of a game and a club’s trend at the end of a season?</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>Does the goalkeeper’s save ability become the key to the team’s victory?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Whether the number of red and yellow cards obtained by players can affect the trend of the team’s season?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Striker, Midfielder, or defender, which position has the most direct impact on the team ranking for each season?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Are the players’ on-field technique values (such as passes, defenses, saves, goals, etc.) have a positive correlation with team ranking?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Does the quantity and quality of penalty kicks determine a team’s performance?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Can a player’s duels won rate determine the outcome of the game?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Can players bring better results to the team as their skill boosts as the season progresses?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Can the number of lineups and appearances of a player determine a game’s result?</strong></p></li></ul><hr><h1 id="Resource"><a href="#Resource" class="headerlink" title="Resource"></a>Resource</h1><p><code>cover image</code>: <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/RR4agxTTYDRBukKE8">https://images.app.goo.gl/RR4agxTTYDRBukKE8</a></p>]]></content>
