      <title>Introduction - ML for the Data of La Liga</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Topic"><a href="#Topic" class="headerlink" title="Topic"></a>Topic</h1><p><em><strong>Is the individual ability of La Liga players a key factor in determining how a club goes throughout a season? Whether a player’s performance on the pitch (such as dribbling, shots, passes, yellow card, red card, etc.) can indicate the outcome of every game and affect a club’s position at the end of each season.</strong></em></p><h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>&emsp;Soccer is the number one sport in the world, with tens of thousands of soccer fans watching every weekend around the world. Many people like the fast pace and physicality of the Premier League, some like the defensive art of Serie A, and some people like the attacking football of the Bundesliga. According to the latest World Soccer League ranking (<a href="https://www.teamform.com/en/league-ranking/world/2024/q1">https://www.teamform.com/en/league-ranking/world/2024/q1</a>), La Liga is second in the world, and the main reason it has a large group fans&#x2F;audience is that La Liga is known for its ball control and exquisite technique. On the pitch of La Liga, each team’s 11 players operate like a sophisticated machine for 90 minutes. Each man on the pitch is a part of the machine, and their performance affects the operation of the entire machine. Therefore, the various clubs in La Liga pay great attention to the comprehensive quality of players. Every touch, every pass, every breakthrough of players on the pitch is silently writing the fate of a club’s entire season. Thus, just by standing on the pitch they are playing a key role in the success of a club. In the data era, the soccer area is like a tiger that has grown wings. A player’s individual stats will become what the team or scout focuses on, which is an essential factor in the success of the club’s strategic development and team management. In addition, it also provides fans with a deeper soccer-watching experience, making each player’s performance stand out to the audience. </p><p><img src="/introduction/1.jpg" alt="The Latest World Soccer League Ranking"></p><p>&emsp;Many people or fans may subconsciously believe that if a club purchases players who have wonderful individual abilities, the whole club will win all the trophies. However, it is not like FIFA or Football Manager games where players can win everything if they are good enough. One of the more famous examples, Real Madrid bought a large number of expensive players(<a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-galactico-ronaldo-beckham-all-real-madrids-super-signings/1lrrb6x9j0n9f1actzefqw47am">https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-galactico-ronaldo-beckham-all-real-madrids-super-signings/1lrrb6x9j0n9f1actzefqw47am</a>) in 2000 and formed the Galacticos I era(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1cticos#First_gal%C3%A1ctico_era_2">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1cticos#First_gal%C3%A1ctico_era_2</a>). At first, as the fans hoped, Real Madrid was able to win various titles from 2000 to 2002. However, since 2002, they have been unable to win any championships just like the honeymoon period of lovers is over. During this period, Real Madrid’s bitter rivals Barcelona won the championships in successive competitions. Therefore, a successful club may not often depend on the outstanding performances of individual players. If the whole club is not well coordinated or appears internal conflicts, the club’s results may also be affected. Besides, a player’s state fluctuation, injuries, and psychological quality are also important factors that affect the results of a game. Even players with outstanding individual skills can hurt the performance of the team once they are out of form or injured.</p><p><img src="/introduction/2.jpg" alt="The Players of Galacticos I Era"></p><hr><h1 id="Resource"><a href="#Resource" class="headerlink" title="Resource"></a>Resource</h1><p><code>cover image</code>: <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/RR4agxTTYDRBukKE8">https://images.app.goo.gl/RR4agxTTYDRBukKE8</a></p>]]></content>
